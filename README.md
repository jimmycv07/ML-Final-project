## Environment 
- It's high recommended to run on the colab, otherwise you will have to reconstruct the environment by [requirement.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12N9gnXQrHMQ3nIDpeOsA2MlswUnykC4m/view?usp=sharing)
## Training
- Edit and make sure the path of training, testing dataset and the sample submission is valid
- Run all and you will get a model store as pickle file

## Inference
- Edit and make sure the path of training, testing dataset, the sample submission and the model is valid
- The model can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12X4cx43WWIcDR1Vp6oNw4KNwrFyZRT4P/view?usp=sharing)
